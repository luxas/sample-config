## Sample Kubernetes ComponentConfig program

This repo demonstrates how you can use the ComponentConfig pattern for enabling file-based
configuration for your program. This project builds on top of the Kubernetes API machinery.

More information about these ComponentConfig conventions might be found in this [KEP]

This repo was made for [a talk I gave at KubeCon China 2018](https://speakerdeck.com/luxas/configuring-your-kubernetes-cluster-on-the-next-level).
The recording of the talk can be found [here](https://youtu.be/klHBzISZkCw).
